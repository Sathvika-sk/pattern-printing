# pattern-printing
This was my first project. I made this by using Python.
In this project, we can print our name in one of the 3 ways. 
1. We can print our name using stars. This means using "*" each letter is made.
2. We can print our name in the shape of diamond. Basically in this we use the letters from the name and shape them in the form of diamond.
3. We can print our name in between two hearts. This is exactly as it sounds.
